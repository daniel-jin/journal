# journal
Simple Journal app to practice MVC separation, protocols, master-detail interfaces, table views, and persistence.

Part One - Model Objects and Controllers
Understand basic model-view-controller design and implementation
Create a custom model object with a memberwise initializer
Understand, create, and use a shared instance
Create a model object controller with create, read, update, and delete functions
Implement the Equatable protocol

Part Two - User Interface
Implement a master-detail interface
Implement the UITableViewDataSource protocol
Understand and implement the UITextFieldDelegate protocol to dismiss the keyboard
Create relationship segues in Storyboards
Understand, use, and implement the 'updateViews' pattern
Implement 'prepare(for segue: UIStoryboardSegue, sender: Any?)' to configure destination view controllers

Part Three - Controller Implementation
Add data persistence using the Codable protocol and write data to a local file path (URL).
Upon launch, decode the data returned from the local file path (URL) back into our custom model objects.
